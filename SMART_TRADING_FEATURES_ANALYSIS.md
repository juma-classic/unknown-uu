## Technical Architecture

```typescript
// Smart Trading Service
class SmartTradingService {
  // Signal aggregation
  aggregateSignals(): Signal[]
  
  // Strategy management
  startStrategy(strategyId: string): void
  stopStrategy(strategyId: string): void
  
  // Stake management
  calculateStake(strategy: Strategy, history: Trade[]): number
  
  // Performance tracking
  trackPerformance(strategyId: string): Performance
  
  // Risk management
  checkRiskLimits(): boolean
  adjustPosition(signal: Signal): void
}

// Smart Trading Component
interface SmartTradingProps {
  strategies: Strategy[]
  signals: Signal[]
  performance: Performance
  onStrategyStart: (id: string) => void
  onStrategyStop: (id: string) => void
}
```

## Features from BinaryFX You Can Adopt

### 1. Multi-Strategy State Management
```javascript
// Track multiple strategies simultaneously
const strategies = [
  { id: 'strategy1', isRunning: true, stake: 1.0 },
  { id: 'strategy2', isRunning: false, stake: 2.0 },
  { id: 'strategy3', isRunning: true, stake: 0.5 }
]
```

### 2. Smart Stake Progression
```javascript
// Martingale with loss count tracking
function calculateNextStake(lossCount, initialStake, multiplier) {
  const maxLosses = 10
  const adjustedLossCount = Math.min(lossCount, maxLosses)
  return initialStake * Math.pow(multiplier, adjustedLossCount)
}
```

### 3. LocalStorage Persistence
```javascript
// Save settings per strategy
localStorage.setItem(`smartTrading_initialStake_${strategyId}`, stake)
localStorage.setItem(`smartTrading_martingale_${strategyId}`, multiplier)
```

### 4. Event-Based Communication
```javascript
// Emit events for state changes
EventBus.emit('smart_trading.start')
EventBus.emit('smart_trading.stop')
EventBus.emit('smart_trading.state_changed', { isRunning, strategyId })
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on Scope**: Choose which option above fits your vision
2. **Design UI**: Create mockups for the Smart Trading interface
3. **Plan Architecture**: Design the service layer and state management
4. **Implement Incrementally**: Start with basic features, add complexity
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure reliability before live trading

You can either:
1. Create a new "Smart Trading" tab that unifies these features
2. Enhance existing tabs with "smart" automation
3. Build a completely new intelligent trading system

Would you like me to help you implement any of these options?
