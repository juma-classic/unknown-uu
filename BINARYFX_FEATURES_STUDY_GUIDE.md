## 📊 Analysis Strategies Implemented

### 1. Rise/Fall Strategy
```javascript
// Analyzes historical price movements
- Tracks rise vs fall ratio
- Calculates confidence percentage
- Threshold: 55% confidence
- Uses configurable tick count (default: 120)
```

### 2. Even/Odd Strategy
```javascript
// Analyzes last digit patterns
- Tracks even vs odd occurrences
- Detects streaks
- Confidence threshold: 55%
- Digit frequency analysis
```

### 3. Over/Under Strategy
```javascript
// Predicts last digit position
- Configurable barrier (default: 5)
- Tracks digits above/below barrier
- Confidence threshold: 55%
- Dynamic barrier adjustment
```

### 4. Matches/Differs Strategy
```javascript
// Identifies digit patterns
- Tracks all digit frequencies (0-9)
- Finds most frequent digit
- Confidence threshold: 15%
- Pattern recognition
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
// Connection details
URL: wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3
App ID: 68848 (analyzer), 52152 (signals)
Protocol: Deriv WebSocket API v3
```

### Key Technical Features:
1. **Auto-Reconnection**: Exponential backoff (max 5 attempts)
2. **Tick History Management**: Maintains sliding window of ticks
3. **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to live tick streams
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on connection loss
5. **Message Protocol**: Uses window.postMessage for component communication

## 💡 Features You Can Integrate

### 1. **Multi-Market Monitoring**
- Monitor multiple symbols simultaneously
- Real-time signal generation
- Color-coded signal strength

### 2. **Probability-Based Predictions**
- Confidence level calculations
- Historical pattern analysis
- Trend detection

### 3. **Smart Reconnection Logic**
```javascript
// Exponential backoff algorithm
delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(1.5, attempts - 1), 30000)
// Starts at 1s, increases to max 30s
```

### 4. **Digit Frequency Analysis**
- Track occurrence of each digit (0-9)
- Identify hot/cold digits
- Pattern recognition

### 5. **Streak Detection**
- Consecutive even/odd patterns
- Rise/fall streaks
- Confidence boosting based on streaks
